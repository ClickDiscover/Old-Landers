                        - At 70+, our 6 Grandmas are looking better than
 ever. They look even more radiant and youthful than they did when they
were years younger! Many have tried to discover their secret: is it
botox, face lifts, or just good lighting?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The truth is much simpler (and cheaper!) than
that. It isn't their makeup that's causing them to look decades younger.
 After many years of trying, our sources finally uncover the truth
behind the anti-aging secret that has taken Hollywood by storm - and
it's one that clever women around the world have been secretly using
too.

                    <h1>The Best Skin Solution You've Never Heard Of</h1>
                    <p>Instead of throwing away precious pounds on
expensive anti-aging skin Serums that make big promises and don't work,
one reader has discovered a skin product that erases years off her face
for only a few pounds. Read on to find out how it works!
                    </p>

                        "Lauren di Fiores was able to remove over 20 years of aging from her face with just 2 simple products!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lauren, a 72 year-old grandma from Louisville,
KY, is a perfect example of how a little smart thinking and ingenuity
can help you avoid unnecessary health risks and save you thousands of
pounds in doctors' bills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like most women, Lauren didn't have the extra
cash to try out every celebrity endorsed anti-aging "miracle Serum" out
there, let alone splurge on expensive elective medical procedures, like
plastic surgery or facelifts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before trying this simple trick, she admits she
used to spend almost an hour every day on an extensive skincare regimen
consisting of over 6 different products, with seriously disappointing
results. Each product made big claims promising to erase wrinkles and
return her youthful skin; and while Lauren followed all their usage
instructions to the letter, she saw no real results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frustrated and let down, she considered going so
 far as to take out a substantial loan for Botox injections, and even
contemplated a highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. But
the high cost (ranging anywhere from £4000 - £12,000+) and the horror
stories of unfixable botched procedures convinced her that cosmetic
treatments were not the solution she was looking for. She was determined
 to find a safe and affordable anti-aging solution that would give her
real results and not leave her digging her way out of a huge financial
debt.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Lauren's Solution:</h1>
                    <p>
                        After a year of doing thorough research and
speaking to other women about their own skincare habits, she learned of
of a product that were yielding real results and helping women take
years off their skin: <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" id="link" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After only a few days of adding <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" id="link" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>
 to her daily skin routine, she saw noticeable results in the mirror.
After just two weeks the proof was staring her right in the face: this
was giving her real results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using the <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" id="link" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>,
 Lauren's results were noticeably better than what you'd find at
medi-spas for £5,000 or more. This removed virtually 90% of all her
wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all
 signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin. Lauren was able to see
these dramatic anti-aging results simply by using <strong>free samples of both products for only 14 days</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Her friends, husband, and family were all
shocked. They were convinced she'd been secretly getting Botox, because
her skin looked 20 years younger almost overnight! Soon, word got around
 as her friends starting using Lauren's method, and not long after, her
easy discovery was featured on The Doctor Oz Show!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lauren is now one of hundreds of women that
share the same incredible story. Using this method, she effectively
erased 20+ years from her skin. It's changed her life and completely
astonished everyone around her, even total strangers!
                    </p>
                    <h1>How does it Work!</h1>
                    <p>
                        Through her research, Lauren discovered that the real secret to <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" id="link" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> are two key ingredients:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Retinol</li>
                        <li>
                            Tripeptide-10</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These are both natural ingredients that work
together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level - below
the surface of the skin - which is why they're so effective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Retinol</strong> is the key to
maintaining healthy, youthful skin. It's a powerful antioxidant that
slows the rate of free-radical damage, which causes skin's dryness, fine
 lines, and wrinkles. It helps combat and even reverse time's effect on
your skin, because it produces collagen - a protein which makes skin
appear plump and firm. Applying Retinol to the skin topically is up to <strong>20 times more effective</strong> than taking it orally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    </p><p>
                    <strong>Tripeptide-10</strong> works by binding to
moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it
an excellent natural skin plumper. Tripeptide-10 helps your skin repair
and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental
stresses, or irritation.
                    </p>

this product a try as the reviews were so good, but I had reservations
because I've been disappointed with things that have had good reviews in
 the past. This stuff works. I don't know if it's because my face was in
 such horrible condition that just two nights of use and I could tell
the difference in the size of my pores, my skin tone was more even, and
my face was smoother and not so bumpy looking. I definitely would
continue to use this product." <strong>Lannie Semira from Lakewood, New York</strong>

                        "I am 57 years old and I do NOT expect any
lotion or Serum to make me look as I did in my 20's; however if I use
<?= $step1_name ?> on a regular basis I
absolutely can tell a difference in my skin tone and the overall
appearance of my complexion. I checked both products out and the reviews
 were great so I decided to give them a try. <?= $step1_name ?> is light, fragrance free, &amp; non-greasy. It has a
fair amount of retinol, green tea, and Retinol plus it is packaged
properly so that the beneficial ingredients are not exposed to the
light, air, &amp; bacteria that destroys them. The free trial was great,
 it allowed me to try them before I bought them.."	<strong>Zoe Clara from Miami, Florida</strong>

 Richard Peters, a prominent dermatologist based in Beverly Hills,
California, revealed to us that <?= $step1_name ?> is the celebrity secret to youthful skin because both products
contain the purest and most powerful forms of Retinol and Tripeptide-10.
 Best of all the products are all-natural, perfectly safe for all skin
types, and have no nasty side effects.

                        What Retinol &amp; Tripeptide-10 do is get rid
of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh
new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 20 to 30 years off
your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the Serums and
serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since
they're not all the same.

                    <p>
                        "The trick is <?= $step1_name ?> that contain high concentrations of pure Retinol and
Tripeptide-10 in just the right concentrations. I also discovered that
they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl
(also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active anti-aging
compound in Retinol). The instructions were easy to follow but very
specific: they're important to follow precisely because it does make a
visible difference. You apply just a light coat of <?= $step1_name ?> on your face and neck after washing and
 drying your face, and gently pat before bed time. I saw results almost
overnight, but after 14 days, the results were literally shocking. I
looked how I used to look 20 years ago!" - <strong>Lauren</strong>

                        I don't know how else to describe it! I could
feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my
forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy -
 the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to
renew my face. After <?= $step1_name ?> was

 it.

 and most of them are ridiculously expensive. With so many options it's
only natural for you to be skeptical about the results, and so I
challenge you to do what I did: <strong>try it for yourself!</strong> Conduct your own study and see the incredible results in your mirror at home. <strong>You won't believe YOUR before and after!</strong>

                                This stuff is amazing! My best friend
Jessica uses it. i
                                couldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;believe it and had
to do some research on my own
                                which is how I found&nbsp;&nbsp;this
news article. I can’t believe they
                                are managed to find some in stock for
us! I know&nbsp;Jessica spent is about to run out so I just linked her
to it. This is a godsend,&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks so much!!

                                I was a bit skeptical when I first read
about&nbsp;this
                                but as I researched more and more I
found out that <?= $step1_name ?>
&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed what Rachael Ray and many scientists say it
is. It’s one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;secret anti-aging products that
                                nobody seems to want to share. I'm not
surprised many
                                celebrities know about this.
