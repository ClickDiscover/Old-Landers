                    <p class="m-t-25"><strong><i>Hollywood Dr's secret to erase wrinkles WITHOUT botox or surgery. See how you can literally save your marriage!</i></strong></p>
                    <p>
                        After  37 years of faithful marriage, Joanie Matthews' relationship failed.  But why?  She began to ask herself all of the typical questions…Is it me? Did I do something wrong? What could I do better?  What she found out shocked her to the core…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apparently, according to her husband, after all the years of living a beautiful (and often stressful) life together she overheard him saying to one his friends…"She just looks so old…shes all wrinkled…I am leaving her to be with Nancy…she's amazing…much younger..."
                    </p>
                    <p>Joanie couldn’t believe what she was hearing!  She began to ask herself…”how could this be?”  She thought  "He was no spring chicken himself at 67 years old!""  At first she cried, her heart was broken.  She thought, “How could the man she loved be so shallow?”  A couple of days later all of that sadness turned to anger and what she did next will shock you…</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/comp1.png" class="img-responsive">
                        <p>Her husband was about to LEAVE her because she was “TOO OLD” Joanie Matthews swore to get revenge by looking the youngest, and most beautiful she had in 37 years</p>
                    <h5 class="text-center"><i><strong>What she heard on The Ellen Show blew her away.  What she did next CHANGED HER LIFE forever…</strong></i></h5>
<p>The problem was my skin was not what it used to be and I thought I just had to live with “getting older”.  I didn’t have ANY wrinkles when I was younger…even into my 30’s.  Now, all the years of stress have taken its toll.  Raising a family, working hard after they left the nest, supporting my husband in his work (and every single thing he wanted to do)…basically <strong>putting everyone and their needs before my own</strong> were definitely showing in my wrinkles.</p>


<p>As the years passed me by the wrinkles just snuck up on me.  I barely recognized the person I saw in the mirror anymore.  How did it get this bad? It happened so fast!  What was I going to do to change it and change it fast…</p>


<p>Then one day, I overheard him saying to one his friends…<b>"She just looks so old and wrinkled.  I really just can’t stop looking at younger women…I am going to leave her"</b>.  As I said before, this broke my heart but quickly turned to anger and motivated like I had never been before.  No way I was going to let something as simple as wrinkles ruin what I had built over the past 37 years.  <strong>Plus, if it was going to end, it was going to end on my terms not his…</strong></p>

<p>I knew that this was something I had to do.  I had to do it for myself.  Not just to try and salvage my marriage but to take back control of my life.  I wanted to be the powerful beauty I once was.  The one he was chasing…the one he couldn’t live without.  Looking back now I am almost thankful for hearing his comments.  In a sick way it motivated me and gave me a drive like never before… </p>

<p>
    Then, like a gift from above, I was watching the <strong>Ellen Show and Diane Keaton revealed Dr. Oz’s skin care secret</strong>.  Dr. Oz had worked with several celebrities over the years and found a series of ingredients that when applied to the face were <strong>just as powerful as botox and had none of the associated risks</strong>.  I knew this was what I had to do and immediately ordered it…the results after 1 week of use were absolutely shocking…
</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/comp2.png" width="100%">

<p>I had done it.  <strong>In a few short weeks I had taken back control of my life</strong>.  My husband was actually chasing me again and I was loving every second of it.  Now I am the one getting attention from younger men and he’s worried I am going to leave him!  Regaining the power position in our relationship was something I thought was impossible.   Now that I have it, I don’t want to ever lose it again.  There isn’t a day that goes by now that I am not grateful for Dr. Oz and his Team, The Ellen show, <strong><u><i><?= $step1_name ?></i></u></strong> and even my husband for motivating me with his terrible comments. </p>

                    <h4>So what is it?</h4>
                    <h4> 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:</h4>
                    <p><strong>1. Trylagen <br> 2. Regu-Age</strong></p>
                    <img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/before_after.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <p class="m-t-25">These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p>
                    <p><strong>Trylagen, The Fountain of Youth:</strong> <br> The first piece of the anti aging puzzle <strong>Hollywood Dr</strong> talked about was <strong>Trylagen</strong>.</p>
                    <img ng-src="<?= $assets ?>/images/botox-comparision.jpg" class="img-responsive" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/botox-comparision.jpg">
                    <h5 class="text-center"><i> "Trylagen is the secret to cheat your age".</i></h5>
                    <p>Trylagen penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study stating, applying non-prescription Trylagen to your skin caused a <strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. Doctor's say this is why <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Trylagen in the right consistency and dosage.</p>
                    <img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <p class="m-t-25"><strong>Regu-Age:</strong> <br> He said the second piece, when combined properly with Trylagen, literally makes your face <strong> look two decades younger in weeks! </strong> Regu-Age works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Regu-Age helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective concentration of Regu-Age was found in <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>.</p>
                    <img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test2.jpg" class="img-responsive m-b-30">
                    <p class="small-text">"What <strong>Trylagen &amp; Regu-Age</strong> do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only one we found during our research were <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?>.</a> This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients." - Dr. Oz</p>

                    <h4>We Decided to Put it to the Test!</h4>
                    <p>As excited as we were after the show and the flood of emails and letters, we wanted to research this ground breaking anti-aging ingredients ourselves before we wrote this feature piece praising them. We decided to take one volunteer from our readers. You've already met Joanie Davis, who jumped at the chance to trial this combo. Here are her results...</p>
                    <h3 class="text-center">Joanie's 14 Day <?= $step1_name ?> Trial Results:</h3>
                    <p>Joanie is a 67 year grandma of 2 from Los Angeles. Like most women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and wrinkles. Joanie said she decided to trial <?= $step1_name ?> because she was so frustrated that nothing else has produced results. She was even considered a highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. <?= $step1_name ?> was somewhat of a last resort for her. </p>

                            <p>I have been using this Anti Aging trial for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good as this mom, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for each! My crow's feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!</p>
