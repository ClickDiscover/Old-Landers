<h1>Dr. Oz and Team Outsmarts Surgeons And Discovers $5 Solution to a Wrinkle Free Face - Diane Keaton Exposes How 74 Yr Olds Look 35 Again!</h1>

<p class="m-t-25"><strong><i>Diane exposed a HUGE celebrity secret to erase wrinkles - without botox or surgery! How 75 Yr Old Celebrities Have Outsmarted Doctors For Years!</i></strong></p>
<p>How do Hollywood starlets look so radiant and youthful well into
their 40's, 50's, and even 60's? Is it always expensive botox and
dangerous plastic surgery? According to Diane Keaton, the answer is NO! So if
they aren't all using surgery to stay looking great, what is their
secret? Keep reading, <strong>it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!</strong></p>
<p>A few weeks ago on The Ellen Show, Diane shared the secret Dr. Oz has been giving celebrity clients who want to look 10 to 15 years younger
fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. We were so suprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was, we had to test it ourself and write a feature article on the results! Read on...</p>
<h4>The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of</h4>
<p>Dr Oz had always kept this wrinkle secret reserved for his high paying celebrity clients...until now. Diane said she felt like she had to let her fans know because she was tired of hearing the countless stories of her viewers throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago <strong>she shared the simple solution he had previously only shared with his celeb clients to everyone watching Ellen!</strong></p>
<p>He actually discovered this anti aging miracle when multiple celebrity friends and clients were constantly reaching out to him hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery. </p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/celeb-collage-55.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<h5 class="text-center"><i>"Countless aging celebs admit they avoided surgery and look 10 years younger thanks to Dr. Oz's simple advice."</i></h5>
<p>On his show he said he was thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, his team came across 2 products that when combined <strong> literally took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and cost next to nothing</strong> ! The solution was a combination of key ingredients found in <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><? $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>"><? $step2_name ?></a>.</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/martha-final.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<h5 class="text-center"><i>"This is the anti aging miracle of the decade as far as I'm concerned." </i></h5>
<h4>So what is it?</h4>
<h4> 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:</h4>
<p><strong>1. Trylagen <br> 2. Regu-Age</strong></p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/before_after.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<p class="m-t-25">These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p>
<p><strong>Trylagen, The Fountain of Youth:</strong> <br> The first piece of the anti aging puzzle <strong>Dr. Oz</strong> talked about was <strong>Trylagen</strong>.</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/ozskin.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<h5 class="text-center"><i> "Trylagen is the secret to cheat your age". -Dr. Oz </i></h5>
<p>Trylagen penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study stating, applying non-prescription Trylagen to your skin caused a <strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. Dr. Oz said this is why <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><? $step1_name ?></a> is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Trylagen in the right consistency and dosage.</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<p class="m-t-25"><strong>Regu-Age:</strong> <br> He said the second piece, when combined properly with Trylagen, literally makes your face look two decades younger in weeks! Regu-Age works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Regu-Age helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective concentration of Regu-Age was found in <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><? $step2_name ?></a>.</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test2.jpg" class="img-responsive m-b-30">
<p class="small-text">"What <strong>Trylagen & Regu-Age</strong> do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><? $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>"><? $step2_name ?>.</a> This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients." - Dr. Oz</p>
<h4>"How do I do it?"</h4>
<p>It's acutally very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Dr. Oz said on the show that, "The trick is to combine <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>"><? $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>"><? $step2_name ?></a>. These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Trylagen and Regu-Age in just the right concentrations. My team also discovered that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active anti-aging compound in Trylagen).</p>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/hawn-final.jpg" class="img-responsive">
<h5 class="text-center"><i>"Getting older is rough for an actress. I feel like a new woman! Thanks Dr. OZ!" </i></h5>
<h4>We Decided to Put it to the Test!</h4>
<p>As excited as we were after the show and after getting a flood of letters, we wanted to try it for ourself before we wrote this feature piece praising it. We decided to take a volunteer from someone in our office. Let me introduce Brenda Wright, a 57 year old mother of 3 who jumped at the chance to test this combo. Here is her story...</p>
<h3 class="text-center">Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:</h3>
<p>Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last resort for her. </p>
<p><strong>Here are her results....</strong></p>

<div class="col-sm-9 p-l-0 p-l-15-mobile">
<p>After the first day of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>"><?= $step2_name ?></a> , I was shocked at the drastic results. <strong>The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!</strong> I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!</p>
<p>I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. </p>
<p>After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.</p>

<h4>DAY 5</h4>

<p>After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES! </p>
<p>The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!</p>
<p>After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. <strong>By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!</strong></p>

<h3>The Verdict:</h3>
<p>Using the <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> combo, removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas.

<h3>Will This Work For You?</h3>
<p>There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are ridiculously expensive. With so many options it’s only natural for you to be skeptical about the results, and so we don't want to promise our readers anything, we simply want to challenge you to do what Dr. Oz recommended on the show: <strong>try it for yourself!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember, you need to use both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> in combination for best results. </strong></p>
<p>For your convenience, I have provided the links to the exact products Dr. Oz recommended. As of the writing of this article they are still offering <strong>Free Trials</strong> of both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>.

<p>I have been using this Anti Aging trial for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good as this mom, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for each! My crow's feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!</p>

<p>I saw this combo on CNN a while ago and still using the combo. I've been using the products for about 6 wks (Natural Ceramides came first, had to wait for <? $step2_name ?> for an extra day). Honestly, this is unbelievable, all I have to say is WOW.</p>

<p>A friend of mine used and recommended it to me 3 weeks ago. I ordered the products and received them within 3 days (although I didn't get the discounted prices). The results have been incredible and I can't wait to see what weeks 3 and 4 bring.</p>

<p>Yes this stuff is amazing! My best friend Gina uses this, I've been trying for years to get rid of my wrinkles and nothing was helping. You alerted me to the possibility of achieving my goals, which is looking great for my daughter's wedding. I just ordered the free trials of the skin creams and I have a very good feeling about them!!</p>
