However, recently she's been turning some heads, with more eyes on her than usual as a First Lady hopeful. Many commentators are starting to take notice of this </span>and wondering, Is it botox, face-lifts, or just good lighting? She has been the trending topic on social media this week, and was not happy about it. "Am I really being accused for plastic surgery?  I've never undergone any surgery, my looks are definitely not from that.  I find it disappointing how tabloids get caught up in appearances so easily." She seemed really appalled, but then laughed "I don't even know why I give critics a reaction, I should know better by now! I will just take it as a compliment!" She chuckled.<span class="tablet-12 phone-12 columns text-center"><br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While she convinced mostly everyone after she spoke out, Many are still trying to discover Melania's secret to always looking radiant and looking younger, despite a stressful career! One person tweeted out, "It just can't be natural, enough said..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many celebrities tend to keep their beauty secrets, well a secret. But to put these "Wild Accusations" to an end, she finally revealed that she uses the popular <a class="linkA" href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> Combo. While this might help the rest of us, it may not be so great for the Royal Family as these are considered top secret beauty tips. Although most people may not know of this method, this is no news to us. We knew it worked well, but we didn't know it worked THAT well! By popular demand, and an influx of messages blowing up our email, we decided to get to the bottom of this, and give you guys the whole scoop, keep reading!</p>

  A few weeks ago on the Dr. Oz show, he shared the secret behind his celebrity clients who want to look 10 to 15 years
  younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox.
  Marie Osmond came on the show &amp; went into detail on the products Dr. Oz has her use &amp; how it got her kicked from CBS. We were so surprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his
  technique was, we had to test it ourself and write a feature article on
  the results! He explained how it wasn't just Marie who had been fired from her job, other celebrities were even being fired from their jobs because of this shockingly simple trick too! But the truth is out now &amp; we have the inside scoop!</p>

<br>
</center>
<h2>The Best Skin Solution You've Never Heard Of</h2>
<br>
<p>Dr Oz had always kept this wrinkle secret reserved for
his high paying celebrity clients until recently. He said he felt like
he had to let his viewers know because he was tired of hearing the
countless stories of his viewers throwing away thousands of dollars on
expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make
big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few
weeks ago <strong>he shared the simple solution he had previously only shared with his celeb clients to everyone watching his show!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He actually discovered this anti aging miracle when
multiple celebrity friends and clients were constantly reaching out to
him hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career
without going in for surgery. </p>
<br>

<span class="text_center"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/demi211.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></span><br>

<br>
<center>
<span class="pageheader">I looked 10 years younger in literally weeks! Dr. Oz literally saved my acting career! </span>
</center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On his show he said he was thrilled when after months and months of
pain staking tests and research, his team came across 2 products that
when combined<strong> literally took 10 to 20 years off women's appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and cost next to nothing</strong>! The two products he mentioned on his show are <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text_center"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/martha-final.jpg" width="100%"></span></p>
<p><span class="pageheader">"This is the anti aging miracle of the decade as far as I'm concerned." </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So what is it?<br>
</h2>
<div class="clr"></div>
<br>
<h2> 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:</h2>
<br>
<p><strong>1. Vitamin C<br>
2. Hyaluronic Acid</strong></p>
<center>
<p><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/before_after.jpg" height="101" width="312"></p>
</center>
<p>These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase
wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level- below the surface of the
skin, which is why they're so effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin C, The Fountain of Youth:</strong><br>
The first piece of the anti aging puzzle <strong>Dr. Oz</strong> talked about was <strong>Vitamin C</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="text_center"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/ozskin.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></span></p>
<p class="pageheader"> "Vitamin C is the secret to cheat your age. -Dr. Oz </p>
<p>Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new
collagen- a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all
the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study
stating, applying non-prescription Vitamin C to your skin caused a <strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. Dr. Oz said this is why <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.</p>
<center>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test1.jpg" height="121" width="250">
</center>
<br>
<p><strong>Hyaluronic Acid:</strong><br>
He said the second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C,
literally makes your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic
Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its
weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic
acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from
dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not
the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective
concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>. </p>
<br>
<center>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test2.jpg" height="101" width="312">
</center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr>
<div class="small">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What <strong>Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic Acid</strong> do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin
generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to
20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose
the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality
ingredients, since they're not all the same. The only two we found during our research was <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a> This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients. - Dr. Oz</p>
</div>
<hr>
<br>
<h2><strong>"How do I do it?"</strong></h2>
<br>
<div class="smallpar">
<p>It's actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Dr. Oz said on the show that, "The trick is to combine <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>.
These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C
and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. My team also discovered
that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called
Dermaxyl (also known as face-lift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active
anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). </p>

<h2>We Decided to Put it to the Test!</h2>
<p>As excited as we were after the show and after getting a flood of
letters, we wanted to try it for ourself before we wrote this feature
piece praising it. We decided to take a volunteer from someone in our
office. Let me introduce Brenda Wright, a 57 year old mother of 3 who
jumped at the chance to test this combo. Here is her story...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="subjectheader">Brenda's Story &amp; 14 Day Cell Revival Results:</h1>
<p>Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most
women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and
wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that
nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly
risky and very expensive face-lift procedure. This was somewhat of a last
resort for her. </p>
<p><br>
</p><p><strong>Here are her results....</strong></p>

<h2>Day One:</h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> <span class="text_center"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/eyes1.jpg" width="100%"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">After the first day of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>
together, I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel.
It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled
by a gigantic vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I
don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling
sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in
the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of
revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. </p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.</p>
<br clear="all">
<h2>day 5:</h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> <span class="text_center"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/eyes2.jpg" width="100%"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">After five days of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>, I was shocked at the drastic results.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong>The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">I
was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger
again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right
off!</p>
<br clear="all">
<h2>day 14:</h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> <span class="text_center"><img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/eyes3.jpg" width="100%"></span>After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and skepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows feet- even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never
felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no
matter how expensive the product!</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">After
the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved
every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years
ago. &lt;strong&gt;By this point, all my friends and family were
shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was
lying about not getting botox!</p>

<h1>The Verdict:</h1>
<p>Using the <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>
combo, removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It
tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and
dehydrated skin.</p>
<p>We had her track her progress for the 14 day test. Here is what she saw:</p>
<br>
<h1>Will This Work For You?</h1>
<br>
<p>There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are
ridiculously expensive. With so many options it's only natural for you
to be skeptical about the results, and so we don't want to promise our
readers anything, we simply want to challenge you to do what Dr. Oz
recommended on the show: <strong>try it for yourself!</strong></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Remember, you need to use both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a> in combination for best results.</strong></p>
<br>
<p>For your convenience, I have provided the links to the exact products
Dr. Oz recommended. As of the writing of this article they are still
offering <strong>Free Bottles</strong> of both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" onclick="loadFB()" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.</a>.
