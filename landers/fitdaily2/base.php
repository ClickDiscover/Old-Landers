- At 70+, our 6 Grandmas are looking better than ever. They look even more radiant and youthful than they did when they were years younger! Many have tried to discover their secret: is it botox, face lifts, or just good lighting?
</p>
<p>
The truth is much simpler (and cheaper!) than that. It isn't their makeup that's causing them to look decades younger. After many years of trying, our sources finally uncover the truth behind the anti-aging secret that has taken Hollywood by storm - and it's one that clever women around the world have been secretly using too.

"The Miracle Anti-Aging Breakthrough - Because It Works!"
</p>
<h1>The Best Skin Solution You've Never Heard Of</h1>
<p>Instead of throwing away precious dollars on expensive anti-aging skin Creams that make big promises and don't work, one reader has discovered a skin product that erases years off her face for only a few dollars. Read on to find out how it works!
</p>
<img style="max-width:100%" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/skin-transformation02.jpg" height="" width="">
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px;">
"Lauren di Fiores was able to remove over 20 years of aging from her face with just 1 simple product!"
</p>
<p>
Lauren, a 72 year-old grandma from Louisville, KY, is a perfect example of how a little smart thinking and ingenuity can help you avoid unnecessary health risks and save you thousands of dollars in doctors' bills.
</p>
<p>
Like most women, Lauren didn't have the extra cash to try out every celebrity endorsed anti-aging "miracle Cream" out there, let alone splurge on expensive elective medical procedures, like plastic surgery or facelifts.
</p>
<p>
Before trying this simple trick, she admits she used to spend almost an hour every day on an extensive skincare regimen consisting of over 6 different products, with seriously disappointing results. Each product made big claims promising to erase wrinkles and return her youthful skin; and while Lauren followed all their usage instructions to the letter, she saw no real results.
</p>
<p>
Frustrated and let down, she considered going so far as to take out a substantial loan for Botox injections, and even contemplated a highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. But the high cost (ranging anywhere from $5000 - $20,000+) and the horror stories of unfixable botched procedures convinced her that cosmetic treatments were not the solution she was looking for. She was determined to find a safe and affordable anti-aging solution that would give her real results and not leave her digging her way out of a huge financial debt.
</p>
<h1>Lauren's Solution:</h1>
<p>
After a year of doing thorough research and speaking to other women about their own skincare habits, she learned of a product that was yielding real results and helping women take years off their skin: <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>.
</p>
<p>
After only a few days of adding <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> to her daily skin routine, she saw noticeable results in the mirror. After just two weeks the proof was staring her right in the face: this was giving her real results.
</p>
<p>
Using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>, Lauren's results were noticeably better than what you'd find at medi-spas for $5,000 or more. This removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin. Lauren was able to see these dramatic anti-aging results simply by using a <strong>free sample of <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> for only 14 days</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Her friends, husband, and family were all shocked. They were convinced she'd been secretly getting Botox, because her skin looked 20 years younger almost overnight! Soon, word got around as her friends starting using Lauren's secret, and not long after, her easy discovery was featured on The Doctor Oz Show!
</p>
<p>
Lauren is now one of hundreds of women that share the same incredible story. Using this method, she effectively erased 20+ years from her skin. It's changed her life and completely astonished everyone around her, even total strangers!
</p>
<h1>How does it Work?</h1>
<p>
Through her research, Lauren discovered that the real secret to <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> are two key ingredients:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Vitamin C</li>
<li>
Hyaluronic Acid</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level - below the surface of the skin - which is why they're so effective.
</p>
<center>
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/before_after.jpg" alt="" height="205px">
<p>The Vitamin C in&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank" href="<?= $step1_link ?>"><?= $step1_name ?></a></strong>&nbsp;restores firmness to your skin while filling in fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
</center>
<p>
<strong>Vitamin C</strong> is the key to maintaining healthy, youthful skin. It's a powerful antioxidant that slows the rate of free-radical damage, which causes skin's dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. It helps combat and even reverse time's effect on your skin, because it produces collagen - a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. Applying Vitamin C to the skin topically is up to <strong>20 times more effective</strong> than taking it orally.
</p>
<p>
<p>
<strong>Hyaluronic Acid</strong> works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic Acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation.
</p>

<img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/bchacid.jpg" alt="" height="181px">
<p>The Hyaluronic Acid in&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank" href="<?= $step2_link ?>"><?= $step2_name ?></a></strong>&nbsp;reduces the depth of wrinkles by adding moisture to your skin.
</p>
<p><strong>Basically, <a target="_blank" href="<?= $step1_link ?>">the combo</a> works in two steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, by reducing and tightening wrinkles</li>
<li>Second, by smoothing &amp; filling in any residual wrinkles left over</li>
</ul>
</center>
<p>
After seeing Lauren on the Dr Oz show a growing list of A-list celebrities that appear to be ditching their expensive Botox treatments for <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> include: Kim Kardashian and Kate Middleton:

<h1>People Everywhere Are Talking</h1>
<img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/ba1.jpg" height="" width="70%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
"I'm 48 yrs old and my face has unfortunately been showing signs of age, dark spots and wrinkles. I decided to give this product a try as the reviews were so good, but I had reservations because I've been disappointed with things that have had good reviews in the past. This stuff works. I don't know if it's because my face was in such horrible condition that just two nights of use and I could tell the difference in the size of my pores, my skin tone was more even, and my face was smoother and not so bumpy looking. I definitely would continue to use this product." <strong>Lannie Semira from Lakewood, New York</strong>
</p>
<img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/ba2.jpg" height="" width="70%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
"I am 57 years old and I do NOT expect any lotion or Cream to make me look as I did in my 20's; however if I use <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> on a regular basis I absolutely can tell a difference in my skin tone and the overall appearance of my complexion. I checked it out and the reviews were great so I decided to give it a try. <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> is light, fragrance free, & non-greasy. It has a fair amount of retinol, green tea, and Vitamin C plus it is packaged properly so that the beneficial ingredients are not exposed to the light, air, & bacteria that destroys them. The free trial was great, it allowed me to try it before I bought it.."	<strong>Zoe Clara from Miami, Florida</strong>
</p>
<img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/ba3.jpg" height="" width="70%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
"Better than ANY other face Cream I have ever tried. Don't spend your money on expensive department store crap. Your paying for advertising and packaging! This Cream is the best and cheapest. Have been using it ever day for the past year and I'll keep using it. I Wish I could give it 10 stars."
<strong>June Witwicky from Los Angeles, California</strong>
<p><img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/drtrust.jpg" height="" width="" style="float:left;padding-right: 20px">Dr. Richard Peters, a prominent dermatologist based in Beverly Hills, California, revealed to us that <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> is the celebrity secret to youthful skin because it contains the purest and most powerful forms of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid. Best of all it's all-natural, perfectly safe for all skin types, and has no nasty side effects.
</p>
<p>
What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 20 to 30 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the Creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they're not all the same.

<h1>Lauren's Story & 14 Day <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?> Results:</h1>
<p>
"The trick is that <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> contains high concentrations of pure Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. I also discovered that it contains all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). The instructions were easy to follow but very specific: they're important to follow precisely because it does make a visible difference. You apply just a light coat of <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> on your face and neck after washing and drying your face just before bed time. I saw results almost overnight, but after 14 days, the results were literally shocking. I looked how I used to look 20 years ago!" - <strong>Lauren</strong>
</p>
<div style="background:#CCC;margin:15px 0;padding:15px;">
<strong>
<span class="step1">Day 1:</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/eyes1.jpg" height="150px" width="" style="float:left;padding-right: 20px">After the first day of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>, I was surprised at how wonderful it made my skin feel. It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a gigantic vacuum cleaner.
</p>
<p>
I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. After <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> was absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span class="step1">Day 5:</span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/eyes2.jpg" height="150px" width="" style="float:left;padding-right: 20px">After five days of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>, I was shocked at the drastic results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 20 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!
</p>
<br>
<p>
<strong>
<span class="step1">Day 14:</span>
</strong>
</p><p>
<img alt="" src="<?= $assets ?>/images/eyes3.jpg" height="150px" width="" style="float:left;padding-right: 20px">After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and skepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!
</p>
<p>
The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows' feet - even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!
</p>
<p>
After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. <strong>By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!</strong>

My friends and I have all been waiting for <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> to hit the news. At least 5 of us have all used <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> and we all use it daily. This stuff truly is incredible and has changed all of our lives. Good luck to everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;who takes advantage of this wonderful opportunity.

I’ve been seeing <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>&nbsp; all
over. I even&nbsp;heard my mom talking about this a few days ago
since one of her&nbsp;&nbsp;friends has 10 years younger after just 2
weeks! I definately have to&nbsp;&nbsp;try this, thanks. P.S. – for all
male readers out there, I found out that this works&nbsp;for
anyone. so give it a try!

This stuff is amazing! My best friend Jessica uses it. i
couldn’t&nbsp;&nbsp;believe it and had to do some research on my own
which is how I found&nbsp;&nbsp;this news article. I can’t believe they
are managed to find some in stock for us! I know&nbsp;Jessica spent is about to run out so I just linked her to it. This is a godsend,&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks so much!!

I was a bit skeptical when I first read about&nbsp;this
but as I researched more and more I found out that <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> &nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed what Rachael Ray and many scientists say it is. It’s one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;secret anti-aging products that
nobody seems to want to share. I'm not surprised many
celebrities know about this.
