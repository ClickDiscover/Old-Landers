<h1>Get Ageless Beauty with Anti-Aging Cream for Perfect Skin</h1>
<p>For all of you who have been following me on Facebook, you know that for the last several years I&#8217;ve been desperately trying to find a face cream that would make my “worn-out” skin look young again &#8211; without spending a fortune.</p>
<p>You also know that I&#8217;ve been doing these blogs every time a try a new product &#8211; and the results have always been the same&#8230; little or no change to my skin&#8230; and lots of wasted time and money&#8230; until I found the MIRACLE combination of <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?> (see links here: <a title="Matrixyderm" href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?>.com</a> and <a title="Beaute FX" href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_name ?>.com</a>).</p>
<p>These two products have changed my life &#8211; and they will change yours too. I PROMISE. My skin went from REALLY bad and REALLY UGLY &#8211; to PERFECT in just 60 days (really) &#8211; and it has STAYED FLAWLESS and PRISTINE for over a year. So ladies &#8211; check out my blog &#8211; check out the websites (that&#8217;s where I started) and then try it for yourself&#8230;. If you send your pictures I&#8217;ll post them here (at the bottom of the blog). Also &#8211; feel free to send me questions!</p>

<h3 class="jTitle">Day Zero &#8211; The Search For PERFECT Skin Begins!</h3>
<p>Ok everyone &#8211; even though I have done this so many times before &#8211; I&#8217;m going to give it another try! I&#8217;m on the hunt for a face cream that will FINALLY get rid of my lines, wrinkles and blemishes &#8211; and give me flawless movie star skin. I hope this search (and this blog) are my last (LOL)&#8230; with so many failures in the past, it&#8217;s hard to be optimistic. So everyone can follow my progress &#8211; here is a picture of how I look right now &#8211; as I start my search for a new cream. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-111 size-full" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1-IMG_8312-modified.jpg" alt="Betty" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<h3 class="jTitle">Day 1 &#8211; ANGELINE JOLIE&#8217;S SECRET To Radiant Skin&#8230; FOR LESS!</h3>
<p>Hey everyone. Well, I decided last night that if I wanted beautiful movie star skin &#8211; I would try and find out how Angelina Jolie keeps her skin looking flawless (thinking I could do the same thing). So &#8211; I spent most of today reading news articles and interviews to see what HER secret to wrinkle free flawless skin is. Well &#8211; the bad news is that she spends $25,000 a YEAR on skin treatments with her dermatologist!!! Yea I know &#8211; it&#8217;s crazy! Here&#8217;s part of the article I found from the UK&#8217;s best-known news outlet &#8211; MailOnline:</p>
<p><i>Angelina Jolie always manages to look radiant on the red carpet.</i></p>
<p>And it turns out that when it comes to maintaining her looks, the actress has yet another trick up her sleeve &#8211; regular high-tech facials from Hollywood&#8217;s top skin doctor, at a cost of $25,000 a year&#8230; The 39-year-old actress met the doctor four years ago on the set of a Russian spy thriller, and since then is believed to have spent (Over $100,000 in just four years on skin treatments)!</p>
<p><b>US DOCTOR Recommends TWO CREAMS for FLAWLESS SKIN:</b></p>
<p>Reading that was a disappointment &#8211; but the rest of my day today was not lost! I found a quote from a US Doctor that said, “If you want Angelina Jolie&#8217;s perfect skin without spending the money &#8211; you can do it inexpensively, at home, using a combination of two breakthrough face creams &#8211; <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?>”. Tomorrow I am going to do some research &#8211; right now I&#8217;m headed to bed!</p>
<h3 class="jTitle">DAY 2 &#8211; I AM TRYING THESE TWO NEW CREAMS &#8211; Ordering was EASY!</h3>
<p>All right everyone &#8211; it&#8217;s the end of another day &#8211; so I thought I&#8217;d give you an update! I spent today looking into <?= $step1_name ?> and <?= $step2_name ?> &#8211; that (from what I have been able to find out) really may be the answer to flawless, smooth, blemish free, wrinkle free “movie star” skin. You can check out the product websites (just like I did) they are: (<a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?>.com</a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step2_link ?>.com</a>). I read HUGE amounts of GREAT things about these products, and the company behind them. They seem to be the REAL DEAL. I&#8217;m going to put down some info on the creams here for you&#8230; but basically the first cream, <?= $step1_name ?>, is an anti-aging cream that will restore your skin, and the second cream, <?= $step2_name ?>, is a 7 in 1 BB cream that will maintain the PERFECT skin you get from <?= $step1_name ?>. Anyway &#8211; here is some general info for you &#8211; I even downloaded some photos (but check the websites for all their details):</p>

<h3 class="jTitle">DAY 5 &#8211; MY FACE CREAMS ARRIVED TODAY &#8211; AND THEY LOOK GREAT!!!</h3>
<p>Hi &#8211; I&#8217;m back! Just three days ago, I ordered my <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?>&#8230; today and it arrived right to my door &#8211; boxed PERFECTLY and SECURLEY! That really was FAST! Just so you can see how much care this A+ Company takes when sending packages &#8211; take a look at these unboxing photos:</p>
<p><i><b>Here are photos of the packages <?= $step1_name ?> was sent in:</b></i></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-60" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_162106.jpg" alt="20141016_162106" width="1024" height="576" /><br />
<?= $step1_name ?> was sent in an &#8220;Express Post&#8221; bag. No wonder it got here so fast <img src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_162717.jpg" alt="20141016_162717" width="800" height="450" /><br />
<?= $step1_name ?> was inside a padded bag that was inside of the express post bag. These guys really take care with their packaging.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-66" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_160824.jpg" alt="20141016_160824" width="800" height="450" /><br />
Here is the padded bag after I pulled it out of the express post bag</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-72" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_160758.jpg" alt="20141016_160758" width="800" height="450" /><br />
And finally here is the <?= $step1_name ?> inside of the padded bag:</p>
<p><i><b>And here is all the Beaute FX packaging</b></i><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_162020.jpg" alt="20141016_162020" width="1024" height="576" /><br />
Beaute FX was sent with Registered Post. Nice!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-73" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_160409.jpg" alt="20141016_160409" width="800" height="450" /><br />
Beaute FX was neatly wrapped up in bubble wrap inside of the Registered Post bag</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-74" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_160306.jpg" alt="20141016_160306" width="800" height="450" /><br />
Here is the <?= $step2_name ?>wrapped in bubble wrap</p>
<p>Well &#8211; after opening the shipping box &#8211; I had a chance to check out both the <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> in person&#8230; and they look absolutely GREAT. Here are my first impressions&#8230;. Since you need to use these creams TOGETHER for PERFECT SKIN &#8211; I&#8217;ll start with <?= $step1_name ?> (as this is the cream to use first)&#8230;</p>
<p><i><b><?= $step1_name ?> &#8211; Unboxing</b></i></p>
<p>As you can see &#8211; <?= $step1_name ?> comes in a VERY high quality box and jar (as good as or better than my department store creams that literally cost TEN TIMES as much!) Take a look:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/th20141016_155710.jpg" alt="th20141016_155710" width="225" height="400" /><br />
I love the packaging <img src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-87" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_155859.jpg" alt="20141016_155859" width="800" height="450" /><br />
Looks very classy!</p>
<p>Judging from the quality of the packaging and container alone &#8211; I&#8217;m feeling confident that <?= $step1_name ?> will REALLY be able to do everything it is supposed to&#8230; “ ELIMINATE THESE 16 PROBLEM AREAS ON A CELLULAR LEVEL”</p>
<ol>
<li>Age Spots &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
<li>Dark Circles &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
<li>Turkey Neck &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
<li>Rough Skin &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
<li>Damaged Skin &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>

<li>Droopy Eyelids &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
<li>Sun Damage &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
<li>Age Damage &#8211; ELIMINATED ON A CELLULAR LEVEL</li>
</ol>
<p>They talk about this on their website (<a title="Matrixyderm" href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?>.com</a>) &#8211; but as you all know &#8211; these are the areas I desperately need HELP in!</p>
<p><i><b>If seeing the beautiful packaging gave me confidence that this might be the product to finally WORK &#8211; the cream that will FINALLY MAKE MY SKIN “MOVIE STAR PERFECT” &#8211; seeing the <?= $step1_name ?> cream itself convinced me of it!!!</b></i></p>
<p>So &#8211; here are the pictures of the opened jar of <?= $step1_name ?>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141016_155915.jpg" alt="20141016_155915" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>This is SERIOUSLY the HIGHEST QUALITY FACE CREAM I have EVER SEEN (and FELT) &#8211; and as you know &#8211; I&#8217;ve tried them all! It is SILKY SMOOTH &#8211; ABSOLUTELY NON-GREASY and has a VERY pleasant VERY, VERY MILD SCENT. I can&#8217;t wait to start my new face regime tonight! I really do think <?= $step1_name ?> is the answer I have been looking for. After seeing this cream &#8211; I see why <?= $step1_name ?> is the “Choice for Today&#8217;s Top Hollywood Stylists”.</p>
<p><i><b>OK &#8211; so that&#8217;s <?= $step1_name ?> &#8211; now let me give you my first impressions of <?= $step2_name ?>&#8230; and why I think it is </b></i><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>THE ULTIMATE BB CREAM</b></span></i></p>
<p>Just like <?= $step1_name ?>, <?= $step2_name ?> comes in a TOP quality box &#8211; and a TOP quality dispenser &#8211; I took some pictures so you can see for yourself:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-107" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/th20141016_155525.jpg" alt="20141016_155525" /><br />
I really like the box. Very pretty</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/th20141016_155938.jpg" alt="20141016_155938" /><br />
I absolutely LOVE the bottle. Such a VIBRANT pink!</p>
<p>The expensive feel of the packaging is TRULY AMAZING, given how low the purchase price was! I really would expect this level of quality to come at a MUCH, MUCH higher price. I guess buying direct from the manufacturer &#8211; unlike buying the BIG NAME BRANDS &#8211; means WAY LESS MARKUP and a SUPER LOW PRICE&#8230; even for a TOP QUALITY BB CREAM. But what really impressed me was the FEEL of this “ULTIMATE BB-CREAM”&#8230;</p>
<p><i><b>Beaute-FX &#8211; This BB-CREAM is AMAZING to the touch!</b></i></p>
<p>So&#8230; the <?= $step2_name ?> packaging is amazing &#8211; but the cream itself seems to be the best part (I just tried a little bit <img src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-76" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20141017_131308-11.jpg" alt="20141017_131308-(1)" /></div>
<p>If you check the <?= $step2_name ?> website (Shown here: <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>"><?= $step2_name ?>.com</a>) you will see that it has been featured in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marie Claire</li>
<li>Elle</li>
<li>Glamour</li>
<li>On TV</li>
</ul>
<p>Judging from the VERY HIGH QUALITY of this cream &#8211; I see how <?= $step2_name ?> (when used with <?= $step1_name ?>) &#8211; PERFECT SKIN IS TRULY POSSIBLE. I cannot wait to put it to the test&#8230; more later&#8230; keep your fingers crossed!</p>
<h3 class="jTitle">BLOG DAY 6 USING MATRIXYDERM &amp; BEAUTE-FX FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME</h3>
<p>Here we go everyone! The real adventure begins on my quest for PERFECT, SMOOTH, FLAWLESS SKIN. I really think the combination of BEAUTE-FX &amp; MATRIXYDERM is the ANSWER&#8230;</p>
<p><i><b>The 24-Hour a Day, 7-Day a Week FACIAL!</b></i></p>
<p>Ok &#8211; after doing some research I&#8217;ve decided to do what is being called the “24-Hour a Day, 7-Day a Week BEAUTE-FX &amp; MATRIXYDERM Facial”. So&#8230; to save you some work, let me tell you how to do it (so, if you want, you can try it too!) It is REALLY EASY and REALLY SIMPLE. All you have to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make <?= $step1_name ?> your PM (nighttime go to bed) Facial cream and&#8230;</li>
<li>Make Beaute-FX your AM (morning, get up and go) BB-Cream.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this system, you will get 24 hour HEALING, RESTORING, LINE ELIMINATING COVERAGE&#8230; and with luck A FACE THAT LOOKS 10, 20 or 30 YEARS YOUNGER.</p>
<p><i><b>Application really is as easy as 1-2-3</b></i></p>
<p>Applying both BEAUTE-FX &amp; MATRIXYDERM is SUPER EASY and SUPER SIMPLE. For BOTH CREAMS &#8211; just follow these 3 SIMPLE STEPS&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1, Wash your face with clean cool water</li>
<li>Step 2, Apply either BEAUTE-FX or MATRIXYDERM</li>
<li>Step 3, THATS IT! YOUR SKIN WILL BE MOISTURIZED &amp; RESTORED!</li>
</ol>
<p><i><b>MATRIXYDERM goes on SMOOTH, LIKE SILK &#8211; NOT AT ALL OILY!</b></i></p>
<p>Well &#8211; so far so GREAT! I just put on MATRIXYDERM for the first time tonight &#8211; and it FEELS WONDERFUL. There is none of that oily, greasy feeling &#8211; just a feeling of SPA QUALITY LUXURY! I really have high hopes that this is THE ANSWER TO PERFECT SKIN that I have been looking for! Headed to sleep now&#8230; I can&#8217;t wait to apply BEAUTE-FX in the morning &#8211; I know it is going to be AWESOME!</p>
<p><i><b>A PERFECT NIGHT WITH MATRIXYDERM</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>My FIRST MORNING WITH BEAUTE-FX &#8211; The ULTIMATE BB CREAM</b></i></p>
<p>Wow &#8211; OK&#8230; I&#8217;m doing my blog first thing this morning, because I wanted to report on my VERY FIRST NIGHT with MATRIXYDERM &#8211; and document my first time with BEAUTE-FX. Let me start off by saying that MATRIXYDERM is like MIRACLE &#8211; SERIOUSLY. Take a look at my skin this morning:</p>
<p><span style="color: #95b3d7;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-124 size-full" src="<?= $assets ?>/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2-IMG_8477-modified.jpg" alt="Betty - first day" width="480" height="640" /></span></p>
<p>I woke up, got out of bed, and looked in the mirror this morning &#8211; to see my SKIN LOOKING HEALTHIER and FIRMER &#8211; OVERNIGHT! We are talking LESS THAN 24 HOURS &#8211; and I am ALREADY SEEING A DIFFERENCE!!! So let me go ahead and try BEAUTE-FX now&#8230; I&#8217;m off to wash my face&#8230;</p>
<p>OK &#8211; I&#8217;m back&#8230; and I&#8217;m about to apply Beaute-FX for the first time. Of course I&#8217;ve used BB Creams before &#8211; but I can&#8217;t wait to see what this will do!</p>
<p>WOW, WOW, WOW!!! I honestly, truly can tell you that this is like NO OTHER BB CREAM you have ever tried. It goes on and feels like something totally different! If regular bb creams are rhinestones &#8211; this is a FLAWLESS Diamond! There is a reason the Beaute-FX is USED BY TODAY&#8217;S TOP MODELS &#8211; because it is clearly the BEST BB CREAM AVAILABLE ANYWHERE&#8230; I AM ASTONISHED!</p>
<h3 class="jTitle">BLOG DAY 7 LET THE 60-DAY FACE LIFT TEST BEGIN&#8230; I&#8217;ll Post Every WEEK For The Next 60 Days</h3>
<p>Well &#8211; I am MORE than HAPPY with the SUPER HIGH QUALITY of the packaging, the EXTREME EASE of ordering, and the VERY fast shipping with <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?>. And I am MORE THAN HAPPY with how <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> smell (or actually don&#8217;t smell) and feel on my skin. These creams are CLEARLY in a class by themselves&#8230; BUT as you know &#8211; I want FLAWLESS, PERFECT, WRINKLE FREE, BLEMISH FREE, MOVIE STAR SKIN &#8211; and I am giving <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> 60 days to transform me&#8230; and regardless of the results &#8211; I&#8217;ll post them here&#8230;. photos and all.</p>
<p>So&#8230; for the next 60 days &#8211; I will post an entry every week, with pictures and comments &#8211; I have my fingers crossed that THESE CREAMS WILL WORK &#8211; and if I&#8217;m not happy &#8211; the company is very fair &#8211; and will refund all of my money &#8211; No Questions Asked&#8230; but if my first day is any indication &#8211; I am betting that <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> WILL WORK! Let the adventure and journey begin&#8230;</p>

<p>Hey everyone&#8230; I am in tears right now &#8211; not because I&#8217;m sad, but because I&#8217;m happy. For so long I wanted perfect skin.

I want you to feel as happy as I do right now</p>

<p>The end is here! The end of week eight&#8230; and nearly the end of this blog! The time seemed to go so quickly. It&#8217;s almost impossible for me to believe that eight weeks ago I had old, tired skin &#8211; and now (just check out my latest picture) I really and truly have FLAWLESS MOVIE STAR SKIN&#8230; Skin just like Angelina Jolie &#8211; and I didn&#8217;t have to spend thousands of dollars to get it! Tomorrow is my last blog entry&#8230; I&#8217;m sad because this experience is coming to an end &#8211; but I&#8217;m SO, SO HAPPY &#8211; because the ending is so TRULY WONDERFUL&#8230; Until tomorrow&#8230; Betty</p>
<h3 class="jTitle">DAY 60&#8230; THE FINAL RESULTS &#8211; WOW! WOW! WOW!</h3>

				<p><strong>I have good, clear skin – for the first time EVER!</strong><br />
I’m only 29 years old – but for my entire life, I’ve suffered with bad skin. Starting at about ten or eleven years old, my skin broke out – and since then I’ve had oily skin, patches of dry skin, pimples… you name it my skin has had it. I never felt pretty – ever – until your blog changed my life.<br />
Up late one night looking for “cures” to my bad skin – I found your inspiring pictures and your story… and figured why not give it a go! That was a little over two months (and a different life) ago. Just using <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> twice a day (once in the morning and one at night as you suggested) my skin went from bad to  flawless! My confidence and my feeling of self worth have soared! I honestly and truly feel pretty for the first time in my life! Thanks you from the bottom of my heart. Keep up the blogs – keep the word going… <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> are really life changing products!</p>

				<p><strong>I was able to reverse “50 years of Sailor’s Face”!</strong><br />
Betty, I’m 62 years old – and since I’ve been about 12, I’ve been an avid sailor. But 50 years on the water (as wonderful as it has been) has taken a real toll on my skin. Sea air, salt water, salt spray, and hours in the sun left me with “Sailor’s Face”! This tanned, wrinkled look is fine for the guys (they call it character!) but on us ladies – it simply equals leathery, old, wrinkled skin (something I’d rather not have, thank you very much!) As an outdoors woman – there is no way I would head to the cosmetic surgeon for peels or lifts… so when I found your blog, and saw your results, I thought I would try <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> too (and I must admit the money back guarantee – something no surgeon would ever offer &#8211; appealed to me also). Well – I am writing to you on the 60th day using these two spectacular creams – and I will tell you that I have been able to reverse 50 years of sailor’s face! My skin has never, ever looked better! I have beautiful, clear, wrinkle free, blemish free ballerina skin! I feel like a delicate woman for the first time in my entire life! I wish this company would advertise – so women all across New Zealand, and all around the globe could feel (and look) as good as I do thanks to <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?>!</p>

				<p><strong>This Old Cowgirl Looks Young Again!</strong><br />
Well a big Texas Hello to you Betty!!! I came across your blog by accident – but what an accident it ended up being! After reading about your transformation – I thought I’d see what <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> could do for my old cowgirl skin! Well – not to mince words – This old cowgirl looks young again! <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> worked for me exactly how it worked for you! My wrinkles, lines and age spots are gone !

				<p><strong>Everyone on set uses <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?>!</strong><br />
Betty – I just wanted to drop you a quick note to tell you to keep blogging! You are 100% correct… <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> creams really do transform bad skin into “flawless, perfect, wrinkle free, blemish free, movie star skin”… I know because the actresses (and actors) I know personally here in Hollywood all use <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> – because it works! I’m so happy you’ve found it and I’m so glad that you are happy now! Take this “shout out” from Hollywood – you are doing a great job… I hope you can let more women know about the transforming power of <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?>! It shouldn’t just be a “Hollywood Secret”!</p>

				<p><strong>You Were 100% Right… It WORKS!</strong><br />
Dear Betty, Thank you so much for writing this blog! After seeing your results I thought I’d give the combination of <?= $step2_name ?> and <?= $step1_name ?> a try for myself… it was the very best decision I ever made! Everything you said was 100% correct! In just 60 days I was able to TRANSFORM my skin – and LOSE 30 YEARS of wrinkles, age spots, and lines. You were 100% right – it works! Again, and from the bottom of my heart, thank you for turning me onto this wonderful (and very affordable) set of creams… I will never use any other product again!</p>
