                    <p>
                        During her decades of marriage, Ashley Davis' skin has deteriorated severely due to constant stress, irregular use of sunscreen, occasional wine, and a few cigarettes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When she overheard her husband of 43 years refer to her as a <strong>“wrinkled old prune” </strong> the Los Angeles, California native, now 67, decided to embark on a wrinkle transformation journey to feel young in her body again — and has wiped an impressive 32 years off her face!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Read on to discover how Ashley Davis successfully restored decades of youth to her face and got revenge on her ex-husband using Dr. Oz's groundbreaking tip.

                        <i>
                            After her husband DIVORCED her because she was “TOO OLD” Ashley Davis promised to get revenge by getting the youngest, most beautiful face she has had in over 20 years.
                            She considered cosmetic surgery but due to being evaluated as a “high risk patient” by her doctor she couldn’t proceed. <strong>Then what she heard on The Dr Oz Show changed her life.</strong>
                        </i>

                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "My skin was tight and pretty when I was younger, and I never had any wrinkle problems. I graduated college without a single wrinkle on my face. When I went to work at a local corporate office, <strong>I developed some bad habits</strong> like not putting on sun screen daily, drinking alcohol, and occasionally even smoking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the decades passed me by, my face shriveled up. The wrinkles snuck up on me. I was <strong>miserable and embarrassed</strong>... When I went out with friends, I found myself constantly feeling insecure and running to the bathroom to put on more makeup. I did not like seeing my own reflection and started avoiding close-up mirrors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day, I overheard my husband refer to me as a <strong>“wrinkled old prune.”</strong> When I confronted him, he went as far as boldly telling me <strong>“I CHEATED on you because you’re too old!”</strong> and then he divorced me! This was a painful, humiliating shock. Until that point, no one had ever addressed the fact that my face had gotten so wrinkled and old and I had been in denial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I am thankful for that comment because it motivated me. I knew I needed to get my face and skin healthy for me, and me alone. Had I not changed my lifestyle, I am certain I was on my way to looking like an old, dried-up prune. I took a long, painful look in the mirror and knew <strong>I had to do something fast!</strong>"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ashley tried one method after another with little or no results. She even considered plastic surgery but was hesitant to go under the knife. Thing were looking hopeless until a few weeks ago while watching The Dr Oz Show, <strong> Ashley listened to  Dr. Oz EXPOSE Hollywood hidden skincare secret. </strong>

                        fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox.

                    <p>
                        When Ashley found out about it, she was so surprised by how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective this technique was, that she had to test it herself.

                    <p>Connie McDonald said she felt that it was her duty to let her fans know.  She was tired of hearing countless stories of her viewers losing $1000's on expensive anti aging products, or dangerous plastic surgeries. As a result, a few weeks ago <strong>she exposed the simple solution Dr Oz had previously only shared with his private clients...to everyone watching The Dr Oz Show!</strong></p>

                    <p>Dr. Oz's big skincare secret is that after months and months of pain staking tests and research, his team discovered 2 products that when combined <strong> literally took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month.

                    <p class="m-t-25">These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proprietary Bisophere, The Fountain of Youth:</strong> <br> The first piece of the anti aging puzzle <strong>Dr. Oz</strong> talked about was <strong>Proprietary Bisophere</strong>.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-center"><i> "Proprietary Bisophere is the secret to cheat your age". -Dr. Oz </i></h5>
                    <p>Proprietary Bisophere penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study stating, applying non-prescription Proprietary Bisophere to your skin caused a <strong>60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles</strong>. This is why <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Proprietary Bisophere in the right consistency and dosage.</p>

                    <p class="m-t-25"><strong>QuSome:</strong> <br> He said the second piece, when combined properly with Proprietary Bisophere, literally makes your face <strong> look two decades younger in weeks! </strong> QuSome works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. QuSome helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective concentration of QuSome was found in <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>.</p>
                    <img src="<?= $assets ?>/images/test2.jpg" class="img-responsive m-b-30">
                    <p class="small-text">"What <strong>Proprietary Bisophere &amp; QuSome</strong> do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research were <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a>. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my private clients."</p>
                    <h4>"How do I use it?"</h4>
                    <p>It's acutally very simple. You simply use both products before bed. On The Dr Oz Show it said that, "The trick is to combine <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>"><?= $step1_name ?></a>. These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Proprietary Bisophere and QuSome in just the right concentrations. My team also discovered that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl <strong> (also known as facelift in a jar) </strong> and Ester-C (the active anti-aging compound in Proprietary Bisophere).</p>

                    <p>As excited as we were after the show and the flood of emails and letters, we wanted to research Dr Oz's anti-aging ingredients ourselves before we wrote this feature piece praising them. We decided to take one volunteer from our readers. You've already met Ashley Davis, who jumped at the chance to trial this combo. Here are her results...</p>

Ashley said she decided to trial <?= $step1_name ?> because she was so frustrated that nothing else has produced results. She was even considered a highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. <?= $step1_name ?> was somewhat of a last resort for her. </p>

He told me that he had "made a huge mistake" and that he had realized that he "can't live without me". He called, texted, and emailed me day and night.

                            <p>I have been using this Anti Aging trial for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good as this mom, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for each! My crow's feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!</p>

                            <p>My sister did this a few months ago, I waited to order my trials to see if it really worked and then they stopped giving out the trials! what a dumb move that turned out to be. glad to see the trials are back again, I wont make the same mistake.</p>

                            <p>Yes this stuff is amazing! My best friend Gina uses this, I've been trying for years to get rid of my wrinkles and nothing was helping. You alerted me to the possibility of achieving my goals, which is looking great for my daughter's wedding. I just ordered the free trials of the skin creams and I have a very good feeling about them!!</p>
