					<p>
						<span class="first-letter">S</span>usan Fuller, a 36 year old divorcee and a mother of three, claims after she got married and had children, her weight gain went out of control. She could barely support her own weight anymore and had to use crutches. Eventually, her unfortunate habit for snacking on junk combined with her genetic inability to metabolize food caused her weight to increase significantly. Just five months ago, she weighed 605 pounds at the nurse's office. Her doctor told her that if she does not lose weight immediately, her life would be in danger.
					</p>

					<p>
					She took drastic action to lose weight. Susan tried her best to lose weight the conventional way, but the results weren't showing. She tried everything, from Atkins to Weight Watchers, from Jenny Craig to Cambridge, nothing seemed to work.
					</p>


					<p> Two months passed and Susan had enrolled in hospital care and the visit from her doctor could not have gone worse. At 630 pounds, her legs had started to go numb. Susan was in tears and panicked. The doctor was disappointed and troubled with Susan's diagnosis and told Susan the most depressing news.</p>

					<blockquote class="article-quote2">
						<span class="message2">"If you can't lose at least 100 pounds in 3 weeks, we will have to save your life by surgically removing your legs."</span>
						
				</blockquote>	

					
					<p>
					She didn't know what to do next, until she saw CHANNEL 5 talk about a controversial new diet with promising results; Garcinia pills in combination with a Toxin Cleanser. The combined effect is clinically proven to not just shred fat off your physique but flush out all the junk in your body and increase your metabolism without harming your immune system.
					</p>
						<blockquote class="article-quote">
						<span class="message">“With the weight-loss transformation came more confidence and optimism in life!”</span>
						
					</blockquote>	
					
					<p><em>
					 Susan decided to give it a try, considering she had nothing to lose.
					  </em></p>
					
					<p><b>
					That day changed her life forever.</b> She lost 63 kg within  weeks and her kids couldn't be more proud of her. With the weight-loss transformation came more confidence and optimism in life! Every week she saw improvement. All she needed was the right push to get her started! These two diet supplements gave her hope that she couldn't imagine three weeks earlier. Now, she's telling everyone she knows about her success and this diet!

<p></p>                  
<center><p>Susan Fuller's incredible transformation from 605 lbs to 466 lbs. After 3 months she was down to 148 healthy pounds! </p></center>

					<p></p><h3>Will This Weight Loss Miracle Also Work For You?</h3>	
					
							
																							
					
					
					<p>Losing weight often feels like an impossible challenge. We have evaluated numerous fad diets over the years. All too frequent the results are just shy of being painfully disappointing.</p>
					
					<blockquote class="article-quote">
						<span class="message">“Women from all over the world achieving amazing results thanks to this new Diet-combination without changing their daily routine”</span>
						
					</blockquote>	
									
					<p>
					The reason why most diets fail, in our opinion, is that they impose unrealistic restrictions on how you live your life. Many dietitians say eat lots of protein others emphasize carbohydrates. In either case, you're left with having to make rather drastic changes to the types of food you eat, when you eat it 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					 No women on earth is waiting for that!
					 </p>
					
					<p>
					Nevertheless, as we began to investigate the countless success stories reported by celebrities from around the world. We decided that this fat loss trend was worth a closer examination. Almost all celebrities didn't change their current lifestyles or food consumption but still managed to lose multiple pounds of pure fat.
					</p>
					
						<h3>PUTTING THIS MIRACLE DIET TO THE TEST</h3>		
					
					<div class="img-text">
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/p2.jpg" class="full-width">      
<p></p>                  
<center><p>The original Garcina Plant</p></center>
					</div>
					
					<b><p>Garcinia has been clinically proven to:</p></b>
						
						<ul>
						<li>Burn bellyfat;</li>
							<li>Destroy cellulite;</li>
							<li>Help Regulate the Metabolism;</li>
							<li>Boosts Energy;</li>
							<li>Rich in Antioxidants;</li>
							<li>Help Eliminate Bad Toxins That Have Built Up Over the Years.</li>
							
							
						</ul>
					
					<p>
					For this test we tried Perfect Garcinia. Perfect Garcinia is one of the most concentrated and purest forms of organic Garcinia on the market.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					At first, I only wanted to try Perfect Garcinia since losing fat was my main goal. However, the pharmaceutical company behind the product advised us that the amino acid boosting, digestive cleansing and detoxifying effect of a Cleanse such as Honest Green Coffee Bean Extract combined with Perfect Garcinia  would create a synergistic effect and actually lead to a 2X increase in fat loss versus using Perfect Garcinia alone. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					So after reviewing the literature, going through most of the success stories and speaking with the our internal medical staff here at Daily Newsfeed, we came to the decision that I would achieve maximum results using both products together, as they were intended. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					It was our shared opinion that this would give me the most accurate results for my test. Below you can see my results and read about them.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					So I went ahead, visited the Perfect Garcinia &amp; Honest Green Coffee Bean Extract website and ordered 2 month supplies of both products. Luckily I only had to pay small amount for shipping and handling!
					</p>
										
					<p>
					They both arrived within 3 days.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Each bottle held a month’s worth of pills which worked out perfectly as I would be following the supplement routine for 4 weeks and documenting my progress along the way.
					</p>
					
					<p><b>
					The product dosage was:
					</b></p>
					
					<ol>
					<li>Take One Organic Perfect Garcinia every morning</li>
					<li>Take One Organic Honest Green Coffee Bean Extract pill in the evening before bed</li>
					</ol>
					
					
					<h3>SHOCKING: I lost 27.5 kg of stomach fat in just one month </h3>
					
					<div class="img-text">
<img src="<?= $assets ?>/ba.jpg" class="full-width">   
<p></p>                     
<center><b>My transformation thanks to Perfect Garcinia &amp; Honest Green Coffee Bean Extract <p></p></b></center>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>
					One week after using both products I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn't even hungry. A welcomed side effect of the Perfect Garcinia diet is its power to curb the appetite. 
					</p>
															
					<p>
					Best of all, I didn’t even change anything about my daily routine. On Day 7, I got on the scale and couldn’t believe my eyes. I had lost 4.5 kg. But I still wasn’t convinced, since they say you lose a lot of water weight at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks.
					</p>
					
										
					<p>
					After two weeks of using Perfect Garcinia and Honest Green Coffee Bean Extract, I started the week off with even more energy and was actually sleeping more soundly than before. I was no longer waking up during the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (I believe this is a result of getting rid of the toxins). Plus I still managed to lose another 5-kg, putting me at an unbelievable 12-kg of weight loss within 2 weeks!
					</p>
					
					<blockquote class="article-quote">
						<span class="message">I still managed to lose another 5-kg, putting me at an unbelievable 12-kg of weight loss within 2 weeks!</span>
						
					</blockquote>	
					
					<p>
					After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, from a 40 to a 36 pant sizes after losing another 15.5 kg. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with the Perfect Garcinia my energy levels don’t dip, instead they remain steady throughout the day.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					After the fourth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 31 kg since starting the Garcinia diet! Actually everyone at Daily for Women is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig. Using both products in week 4, I lost an additional 11 kg.
					</p>
