								(The Dr. Oz Show) - <b><b><?= $step1_name ?></b></b> is the latest buzz in the "battle of the bulge". With millions of people praising this so called "miracle pill" that you take as a supplement to lose weight, it has been getting a lot of attention since it was recently featured on popular tv shows.<br>
								<br>
								<b><?= $step1_name ?></b> contains all of the Ingredients that Doctors have shown to help Battle the Fight with your expanding Waist! Our Exclusive Formula Includes Caralluma (Appetite Suppresant), Forskolin, Raspberry Ketones (Carb Blocker), Garcinia Cambogia (HCA Causes Weight Loss), White Kidney Bean, Green Tea, and of course <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> (Metabolism Booster)!<br>
								<br>
								Surprisingly, many people who struggle daily with their weight have yet to hear about this powerful option. Those that have heard of the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> diet are confused about what it is, how to use it and how to avoid falling for ineffective formulas and downright scams.<br>

									<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Harvard study shows 73% of Americans have "bad" bacteria that stops weightloss!</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p class="common-txt"> This study explains why so many millions of people struggle to lose weight after trying everything!<br>
									<br>
									The problem is that processed foods, sodas, and even diet drinks "feed" bacterial colonies in your body. The bacteria that gets the most from our modern diet is the type that holds onto those extra pounds and makes it hard to keep yourself at your goal weight.<br>
									<br>
									<b>"You have a high chance of deserving a slimmer body, but your body's digestive bacteria is stopping your progress." - Dr. Travis Stork</b> </p>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">How <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> Helps You Lose The Most Stubborn Pounds</h2>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p class="common-txt"> According to Dr. Travis Stork, <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> works in more than one way. It removes fat-creating "bad" bacteria from your body, and gives you healthy "good" bacteria to help control sugars in your digestive system.<br>
									<br>
									"The first way is <b><b><?= $step1_name ?></b> goes in and kills all the "bad" bacteria in your body</b>. These "bad" bactiera change your body so sugar and fats make you gain more weight than normal. The bacteria lives mainly in your lower intestines."<br>
									<br>
									"The second way, the most important way, is <b><b><?= $step1_name ?></b> adds "good" bacteria to your system, which helps your body control your weight.</b> So then you don't have "bad" bacteria making your body gain weight faster, and "good" bacteria stops you from gaining more weight. <br>
									<br>
									"Thirdly the combination of all of the doctor's heralded ingredients will Curb Your Appetite, Burn More Fat, Boost your Metabolism and provide you with All Day Long ENERGY!!!<br>
									<br>
									When these THREE things are combined together, you get this synergistic effect that basically <b>Burns, Blocks and Stops fat, but it also is 100% NATURAL and Safe.</b>" </p>

								<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">We Tried <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> For Ourselves</h2>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p class="common-txt"> Well, we here on The Dr. Oz Show were a little skeptical of this <?= $step1_name ?>. Even after pouring though mountains of research. While I had an educated opinion, I still had no personal proof that the <?= $step1_name ?> option was worth the time. So, with my editors blessing, I decided to go out and put the product to the test myself. What better way to find out the truth that to conduct my own study? </p>
								<p class="common-txt"> To get started, I volunteered to be the guinea pig. I applied online for a bottle of <?= $step1_name ?>. <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> is one of the most credible and trustworthy diet supplement suppliers on the market. It included a 100% Money Back Guarantee of the product and it did not try to fool me into agreeing to additional hidden offers. Another reason why I chose <?= $step1_name ?> is because it is the most concentrated and purest <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> on the market. This would give me the most accurate results for my test. </p>

								<p class="common-txt"> I originally wanted to lose weight to please my husband. We got divorced before I was able to lose weight. When he saw my new figure recently, he wanted to reconcile. I told him, 'too late'!" </p>

								<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">My Results</h2>
								<div class="result-box"> <span>Week One</span>
									<p> After one week on the diet I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn't even hungry, an apparent side effect of the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> which curbs the appetite.<br>
										<br>
										I honestly felt fantastic.<br>
										<br>
										And I didn't even change anything about my daily routine. On day 7 I got on the scale and couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost 8 lbs. But I still wasn't convinced as they say you lose a lot of water at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks. But it sure was looking up! I now weighed under 150 lbs for the first time in years! </p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
									<center>
										<img src="<?= $assets ?>/devider.jpg">
									</center>
								</div>
								<div class="result-box"> <span>Week Three</span>
									<p> After three weeks, I started the week off with even more energy and was actually sleeping more soundly than before. I was no longer waking up during the night and tossing and turning because my body was actually able to relax (this is a result of getting rid of the toxins I think, a great benefit of the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b>). Plus I still managed to lose another 5 lbs, putting me at an unbelievable 13 lbs of weight loss, in just 3 weeks.<br>
										<br>
										I must admit that I'm starting to believe that this diet is more than just a gimmick. </p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
									<center>
										<img src="<?= $assets ?>/devider.jpg">
									</center>
								</div>
								<div class="result-box"> <span>Week Four</span>
									<p> After 4 weeks all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down, 2 full dress sizes, after losing another 3 lbs. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, you tend to run out of steam. But with the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> my energy levels don't dip, but remain steady throughout the day. I no longer need that cat nap around 3pm in the afternoon! And I am even noticing that my stomach is digesting food so much better as a result of the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> supplement. No more bloating or embarrassing gas after I eat! </p>
									<div class="clear"></div>
									<center>
										<img src="<?= $assets ?>/devider.jpg">
									</center>
								</div>
								<div class="result-box"> <span>Week Nine</span>
									<p> After the Ninth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 36 lbs of fat since starting the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> diet! Actually everyone on The Dr. Oz Show is kicking themselves for not having volunteered to be the guinea pig. Using the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> in the last five weeks I lost 21 more lbs. To be honest I really don't have much more left to lose, and I've never looked sexier! I am definitely going to continue taking the <b><?= $step1_name ?></b> afterwards because it has so many antioxidants and vitamins that makes my skin look unbelievable. It even worked better than Green Coffee!<br>
										<br>
										'I couldn't be any happier with the results.<br>
										<br>
										I Lost 36 lbs body fat in 9 Weeks, No Special Diet, No Intense Exercise' </p>

								<p class="common-txt"> Like us, here on The Dr. Oz Show, you might be a little doubtful about the effects of this diet, but you need to try it for yourself; <b>the results are real.</b> After conducting our own personal study we are pleased to see that people really are finding success with it (myself included!).
