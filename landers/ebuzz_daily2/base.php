						<span class="message">“The miracle fat-buster because it works!” - Tv Dr</span>

					</blockquote>

				<p>Waves of top female celebrities have lost a significant amount of body fat with just these 2 diet cleanses.
				The combined effect is clinically proven to not just rapidly burn fat off your physique but as importantly, to f
				lush out all the destructive toxins in your body and increase your metabolism, all without harming your immune system.
</p>
				<p>By now you've probably heard of the newest "SuperFood"
				<a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><span><?= $step1_name ?></span></font></a>. It's been mentioned on TV as a "miracle in the medicine cabinet"
			    and is responsible for tons of success stories of people who has used it and lost
			    an average of 21 lbs in 4 weeks. Now it’s being combined with
			    all-natural
			    <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><span><?= $step2_name ?></span></font></a> for even more effective weight loss as published in a recent study.
</p>

				<p>According to Dr Chen (The guest host on the popular Dr TV show), <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><span><?= $step1_name ?></span></a>
	works in more than one way, <em>"The first way is it goes in and causes the body to burn glucose, or sugar, and burn fat,
	mainly in the liver…The second way, the most important way, is it slows the release of sugar into the blood stream.
	So when you don't have sugar building up in the blood stream, you don't have fat building up because sugar turns to fat. When the
	two are combined together, you get this synergistic effect that basically burns
	and blocks and stops fat, but it also is natural and safe."</em>

			<p>Losing weight often feels like an impossible challenge. We have evaluated numerous fad diets over the years. All too frequent the results are just shy of being painfully disappointing.</p>

					The reason why most diets fail, in our opinion, is that they impose unrealistic restrictions on how you live your life. Many dietitians say eat lots of protein others emphasize carbohydrates. In either case, you're left with having to make rather drastic changes to the types of food you eat, when you eat it
					</p>

					<p>
					 No women on earth is waiting for that!

					<p>
					Nevertheless, as we began to investigate the countless success stories reported by
					celebrities from around the world. We decided that this fat loss trend was worth
					a closer examination. Almost all celebrities didn't change their current lifestyles
					or food consumption but still managed to lose multiple pounds of pure fat.
					</p>
<p>To get started, I contacted the company for trial bottles of <?= $step1_name ?> for our case study. While there are many different
suppliers of <?= $step1_name ?>, <?= $step1_name ?> contains the only patented <?= $step1_name ?> Extract on the market,
supported by multiple published clinical studies. It's the purest and most potent <?= $step1_name ?> out there.</p>

<p>This trustworthy company offers a trial bottle of their products with reduced shipping and did not try to
trick people into agreeing to additional hidden offers. </p>
<h2 id="reisen">PUTTING THIS MIRACLE DIET TO THE TEST</h2>
<b><p><a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><?= $step1_name ?></a></font> has been clinically proven to:</p></b>

						<ul>
						<li>Burn bellyfat;</li>
							<li>Destroy cellulite;</li>
							<li>Help Regulate the Metabolism;</li>
							<li>Boosts Energy;</li>
							<li>Rich in Antioxidants;</li>
							<li>8X Times More Weight Loss Than Diet and Exercise.</li>


						</ul>

					<p>
					For this test we tried
<a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><?= $step1_name ?></a></font>. <?= $step1_name ?> is one of the most concentrated and purest forms of organic <?= $step1_name ?> on the market.
					</p>

					<p>
					At first, I only wanted to try <?= $step1_name ?> since losing fat was my main goal. However, the pharmaceutical company behind the product
					advised us that the amino acid boosting, digestive cleansing and detoxifying effect of a Cleanse
					such as <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><?= $step2_name ?></a></font> combined with <?= $step1_name ?>  would create a synergistic effect and actually lead to a 2X increase in fat loss versus using <?= $step1_name ?> alone.
					</p>
					<b><p><a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><?= $step2_name ?></a></font> has been clinically proven to:</p></b>

						<ul>
						<li>Help eliminate bad toxins that have built up over the years;</li>
							<li>Removes 'Sludge' from the walls of the colon;</li>
							<li>Helps get rid of gas and bloating;</li>
							<li>Boosts Energy;</li>
							<li>Rich in Antioxidants;</li>
							<li>Level blood sugar.</li>


						</ul>
					<p>
					So after reviewing the literature, going through most of the success stories and speaking with the our internal medical staff here at Daily Newsfeed, we came to the decision that I would achieve maximum results using both products together, as they were intended.
					</p>

					<p>
					It was our shared opinion that this would give me the most accurate results for my test. Below you can see my results and read about them.
					</p>

					<p>
					So I went ahead, visited the <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><?= $step1_name ?></a></font>
					& <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><?= $step2_name ?></a></font> website and ordered 2 month supplies of both products. Luckily I only had to pay small amount for shipping and handling!
					</p>

					<p>
					They both arrived within 3 days.
					</p>

					<p>
					Each bottle held a month’s worth of pills which worked out perfectly as I would be following the supplement routine for 4 weeks and documenting my progress along the way.
					</p>

					<p><b>
					The product dosage was:
					</p></b>

					<ol>
					<li>Take One <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="_blank">Organic <font color="blue"><?= $step1_name ?></a></font> every morning</li>
					<li>Take One <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="_blank">Organic <font color="blue"><?= $step2_name ?></a></font> pill in the evening before bed</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
					Best of all, I didn’t even change anything about my daily routine. On Day 7, I got on the scale and couldn’t believe my eyes. I had lost 4.5 lbs.

				What a jerk that guy is but just look at Mary now!! I have been using this weight loss combo for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good as this Khloe Kardashian, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for each! My tummy and arm fat is melting away more and more every day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!

					Way to go Mary! I saw this combo on 7news a while ago and still using the combo. I've been using the products for about 6 wks (<?= $step1_name ?> came first, had to wait for <?= $step2_name ?> for an extra day). Honestly, this is unbelievable, all I have to say is WOW..</p></div></div>

					A friend of mine used and recommended it to me 3 weeks ago. I ordered the products and received them within 3 days (although I didn't get the discounted prices). The results have been incredible and I can't wait to see what weeks 3 and 4 bring.</p></div></div>
