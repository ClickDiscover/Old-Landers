						<h1>After a 75-year career, beloved TV veteran Betty White finally calls it quits!</h1>
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/featured.png">
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/newsarticles.png">
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/d3-betty_v2a1.jpg">
						<p>It's hard to believe Betty White has been on TV for over 75 years. The 93 year old actress proves she's still got it! In an exclusive interview, we asked Betty how she's stayed so beautiful throughout the years; And her reply was simply, "I take care of myself.. Everyday. I don't feel 93 at all. Doctor Oz who I adore dearly has the elixir of youth for me. I visit him every month for my routine skin care facials."</p>
						<p>Just what the Doctor ordered.. Betty White credits Dr Oz for keeping her looking young and beautiful. Upon more research, we've discovered that it's one clever women around the world - and many Hollywood actresses - have been secretly using too.</p>
						<p> It recently was a celeb secret until Amy Davis, a 54 year-old mother of three from Los Angeles, California was featured on the Dr. Oz Show. Amy's testimonial revolutionized the industry. A perfect example of how a little smart-thinking and ingenuity can help you avoid unnecessary health risks and save you thousands of dollars in doctors' bills. </p>
						<p>Like most women, Amy didn't have the extra cash to try out every celebrity-endorsed anti-aging "miracle cream" out there, let alone splurge on expensive elective medical procedures, like plastic surgery or facelifts. </p>
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/d2-betty_v2a1.jpg">
						<div class="caption">Betty stumbled upon a shocking skin secret - one that's changing her life (and her face!) each and every day. Upon more research, we've discovered that it's one clever women around the world - and many Hollywood actresses - have been secretly using too. Scroll below for a video of shocking results!</div>
						<h2>The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of</h2>
						<p>Dr Oz had always kept this wrinkle secret reserved for his high paying celebrity clients until recently. He said he felt like he had to let his viewers know because he was tired of hearing the countless stories of his viewers throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago <strong>he shared the simple solution he had previously only shared with his celeb clients to everyone watching his show!</strong></p>
						<p>He actually discovered this anti aging miracle when multiple celebrity friends and clients were constantly reaching out to him hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery. </p>
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/d1-betty.jpg">
						<div class="caption">“I looked 10 years younger in literally weeks! Dr. Oz literally saved my acting career!” </div>
						<p>On his show he said he was thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, his team came across 2 products that when combined literally took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and cost next to nothing! The two products he mentioned on his show are <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>.</p>
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/martha-final.jpg">
						<div class="caption">Celebs have been raving about <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. They confess that it's the secret to their youthful skin. </div>
						<h2>So what is it?</h2>
						<h2>2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:</h2>
						<p><strong>1. Vitamin C</strong></p>
						<p><strong> 2. Hyaluronic Acid</strong></p>
						<img class="<?= $assets ?>/img_auto" src="<?= $assets ?>/img/before_after.jpg">
						<p>These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the skin – which is why they’re so effective.</p>
						<p><strong>Vitamin C, The Fountain of Youth:</strong></p>
						<p> The first piece of the anti aging puzzle <strong>Dr. Oz</strong> talked about was <strong>Vitamin C</strong>.</p>
						<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/ozskin.jpg">
						<div class="caption">"Vitamin C is the secret to cheat your age”. -Dr. Oz </div>
						<p>Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study stating, applying non-prescription Vitamin C to your skin caused a 60% reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. Dr. Oz said this is why <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.</p>
						<img class="<?= $assets ?>/img_auto" src="<?= $assets ?>/img/test1-b.jpg">
						<p><strong>Hyaluronic Acid:</strong></p>
						<p> He said the second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C, literally makes your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. He said one of, if not the only products you can buy over the counter with an effective concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. </p>
						<img class="<?= $assets ?>/img_auto" src="<?= $assets ?>/img/test2-b.jpg">
						<div class="little_box">
							<p>“What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin generate fresh new ones. Our tests show that you can erase almost 10 to 20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.” - Dr. Oz</p>
						</div>
						<h2>"How do I do it?"</h2>
						<p>It's acutally very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Dr. Oz said on the show that, "The trick is to combine <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. My team also discovered that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). </p>

						<h2>We Decided to Put it to the Test!</h2>
						<p>As excited as we were after the show and after getting a flood of letters, we wanted to try it for ourself before we wrote this feature piece praising it. We decided to take a volunteer from someone in our office. Let me introduce Brenda Wright, a 57 year old mother of 3 who jumped at the chance to test this combo. Here is her story...</p>
						<h1>Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:</h1>
						<p>Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last resort for her. </p>
						<p><strong>Here are her results....</strong></p>
						<div class="grey_box">
							<div class="gb_inner">
								<h2>Day 1</h2>
								<div class="pic">
									<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/eyes1.jpg">
								</div>
								<div class="text">
									<p>After the first day of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> together, I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a gigantic vacuum cleaner.</p>
									<p>I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. </p>
									<p>After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.</p>
								</div>
								<h2>Day 5</h2>
								<div class="pic">
									<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/eyes2.jpg">
								</div>
								<div class="text">
									<p>After five days of using <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>, I was shocked at the drastic results.</p>
									<p><strong>The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!</strong></p>
									<p>I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!</p>
								</div>
								<h2>Day 14</h2>
								<div class="pic">
									<img src="<?= $assets ?>/img/eyes3.jpg">
								</div>
								<div class="text">
									<p>After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and skepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!</p>
									<p>The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!</p>
									<p>After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<h1>The Verdict:</h1>
						<p>Using the <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> combo, removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin.</p>
						<h1>Will This Work For You?</h1>
						<p>There are plenty of skincare gimmicks out there, and most of them are ridiculously expensive. With so many options it’s only natural for you to be skeptical about the results, and so we don't want to promise our readers anything, we simply want to challenge you to do what Dr. Oz recommended on the show: <strong>try it for yourself!</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Remember, you need to use both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?></a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a> in combination for best results.</strong></p>
						<p>For your convenience, I have provided the links to the exact products
 Dr. Oz recommended. As of the writing of this article they are still
offering <strong>Free Bottles</strong> of both <a href="<?= $step1_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step1_name ?> Treatment</a> and <a href="<?= $step2_link ?>" target="blank"><?= $step2_name ?></a>. Use the links below and you will get the lowest possible shipping price as well.</p>

								<p>I have been using this Anti Aging trial for 3 weeks now, and I seriously look 5 years younger! Not quite as good as this mom, but I will take it when it was less than 5 bucks for each! My crow's feet and laugh lines are melting away more and more every day. Thank you so much for reporting on this!</p>

								<p>I was a bit skeptical when I first read about this but as I researched more and more I found out that is indeed what Rachael Ray and many scientists say it is. It´s one of the secret anti-aging products that nobody seems to want to share. I wouldn´t be surprised many celebrities know about this. I requested for the and the 1 month supply and I´m so excited! I cannot wait for them get here!</p>
